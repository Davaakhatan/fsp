# Product Context

## Why This Exists

### The Student Problem
Prospective pilots starting their flight training journey face:

**Information Overload**:
- 500+ flight schools across the US alone
- Each school's website presents data differently
- No standard format for costs, timelines, or requirements
- Outdated information (pricing, fleet, availability)

**Decision Paralysis**:
- How to compare School A at $60k vs School B at $70k?
- Which program is faster? Part 61 vs Part 141?
- Which schools have good aircraft availability?
- Which schools actually deliver on their promises?

**No Trust Signals**:
- All schools claim to be "the best"
- No objective quality metrics
- Reviews are scattered across Google, Yelp, Reddit
- Hard to verify claimed hours, costs, timelines

**Time-Consuming Research**:
- Weeks of manual research
- Calling dozens of schools
- Spreadsheet management
- Still uncertain about decision

### The School Problem
Flight schools struggle to stand out:

**Price-Only Competition**:
- Race to the bottom on pricing
- Cannot highlight operational excellence
- Quality schools lose to cheaper (but worse) options

**No Credibility Mechanism**:
- "Trust us" marketing doesn't work
- Cannot prove training velocity or reliability
- Hard to showcase student outcomes

**Limited Reach**:
- Local marketing only
- Word-of-mouth takes time
- Generic directory listings
- No differentiation from competitors

**Lead Quality**:
- Tire-kickers waste time
- Unqualified inquiries
- No pre-screening
- Low conversion rates
